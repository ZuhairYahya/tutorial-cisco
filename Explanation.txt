Router 1

Configuring the router by adding an IP address that points to router 0 or router 2. By configuring through the Fast Ethernet 0/0 interface used on router 1 that leads to the router 2. The purpose of the Fast Ethernet 0/0 interface itself is that we consider it the router has 2 gates to enter router 2, and fa0 / 0 is as a gateway to enter router 2. And also likewise with fa1 / 0 is as a gate to enter router 0.
Then enter the ip address and subnet mask used on that ip address. On fa0 / 0 use the ip address 12.12.12.2 with the subnet mask 255.255.255.252. Then for fa1 / 0 use the ip address 10.10.10.2 with the subnet mask 255.255.255.252. Next do the command no sh (no shutdown) which is a command to activate the administrative interface so that the cable that leads to the router port will be active and green.

Router 0

Configure the router by adding the IP address that leads to router 1 and to the client that passes the switch. By configuring through the Fast Ethernet 0/0 interface that is used on router 0 that leads to router 1. And also configuring via the Fast Ethernet 1/0 interface that is used router 0 that points to the client.
Then enter the ip address and subnet mask used on that ip address. On fa0 / 0 use the ip address 10.10.10.1 with the subnet mask 255.255.255.252. Then for fa1 / 0 use the ip address 192.168.1.1 with the subnet mask 255.255.255.224. Next do the command no sh (no shutdown) which is a command to activate the administrative interface so that the cable that leads to the router port will be active and green.

Router 2

Configure the router by adding the IP address that leads to router 1 and to the client that passes the switch. By configuring through the Fast Ethernet 0/0 interface used on router 2 that leads to router 1. And also configuring via the Fast Ethernet 1/0 interface that is used router 2 that points to the client.
Then enter the ip address and subnet mask used on that ip address. On fa0 / 0 use the ip address 12.12.12.1 with the subnet mask 255.255.255.252. Then for fa1 / 0 use the ip address 192.168.2.1 with the subnet mask 255.255.255.224. Next do the command no sh (no shutdown) which is a command to activate the administrative interface so that the cable that leads to the router port will be active and green.

After configuring the router, then configuring the client will be able to connect to the same network.
